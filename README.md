# tech-challenge-maven

## What is the challenge about? 
It is an online game, where multiple teams will be playing at the same time and each team has to develop a bot or a client that follows the game’s algorithm and rules, which will be disclosed on the day of the event, at 9 in the morning. 

As the game requires JVM skills, the challenge is open to professionals with at least 3-years proven experience in JVM languages (think Java, Scala, Kotlin etc.). 
So get a tech friend (outside ING) and show the world what you're made of. 
 
## Scoring 
You play for fun and you play to win, so we're keeping track. Each team will be scored based on the efficiency of the code they write (translated into points won in each round); this will weigh 85% of the final score and will be displayed in real time. The remaining 15% will be graded by ING Tech Romania’s jury-team upon reviewing your code.
